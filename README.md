# Battleships game

## How to play

Battleships game it's inspired by the classic [Battleship (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

In this version, the game has a turn limit depending on the board size chosen by the player, and three different types of ships with varying point values and sizes:

- Big(3x3) = 1 point
- Medium(2x2) = 2 points
- Small(1x1) = 3 points

After entering your username and the size of the boards, two boards will be randomly generated, one for each player. The player's ships are indicated on his board with and **O**, while the computer's ships remains hidden.

Then, player and computer by turns try to sink each other's ships.

Hits are marked on the board with **Ã˜**, while misses are marked with **X**.

The winner it's the first who sinks all opponent's ships or who has the highest score when the turns are over.

Once the game it's over you can enter **Y** to play again or **N** to stop playing.


## Features

### Existing features

- Random board generation

    - After the player enters the username and the board size, two boards with that size are generated and populated randomly with the correct amount of ships for that board size.
    - Also shows the information of the ships on this game aswell and the turns limit.
    - The player cannot see where the computer's ships are placed.

        ![Random board generator](assets/images/board_size_7.png)

- Input validation and error-checking
    
    - For the username:
        - Username cannot be empty
        - Username only can contain letters, digits or spaces
        - Cannot start or end with space
        - Cannot have more two or more spaces in a row
        - Must be between 4-11 characthers
    
        More details on [Username testing](#username)

    - For the size:
        - Size cannot be empty
        - Sise must a numeric
        - Size must be between 4-10

        More details on [Size testing](#size)

    - For the row and column:
        - Row and column cannot be empty
        - Row and column must be integer numbers
        - Row and column must be between 0 and (board size-1)
        - A row and column that already missed cannot be introduced again
        - Cannot introduce the row and column of a sunk ship

        More detail on [Row and column testing](#row-and-columns)  

    - For play again:
        - Must not be empty
        - Must be 'Y', 'y', 'n' or 'N'
        
        More details on [Play again testing](#play-again)

- Data maintained in class instances

    - I have been using Game, Board and Ship Classes to work with the data, such as username, player board, computer board, turns limit...
    More detail on [Data model](#data-model)

- Different size of ships with differents points value

    - I used 3 types of ships on this proyect:
        
        - Small ship: It's a 1x1 ship with a value of 3 points
        - Medium ship: It's a 2x2 ship with a value of 2 points
        - Big ship: It's a 3x3 ship with a value of 1 points
    
        The small ship have a bigger value than the other ones because it's harder to hit a 1x1 than a 2x2 or 3x3.

- Option to play again when finish

    - Once the game it's over the player have the option to play again or to stop playing.

        ![Play again](assets/images/play_again.png)

- Turns limit game

    - The game has a turn limit based on the size of the board. Once it reches 0 the game finish and who has more points wins.

        ![Turns limit finished](assets/images/player_win_1.png)

- Round information

    - After the player make a guess, a round information will appear to let him know if he hitted or not, if the computer hitted or not, the turns remaing and the scores. Also will print the updated boards with the last hits/misses.

        ![Round information](assets/images/round_information.png)

- Game over information

    - When the game it's over, will show the reason why the game it's over, the final scores, the final boards with the remaing computer ships on it, and the winner.

        ![Gameover information](assets/images/gameover_information.png)



## Data model

I decided to use Game, Board and Ship classes as my model

- **Ship Class**

    This class it's a superclass for 3 subclasses:
    
    - SmallShip
    - MediumShip
    - BigShip

    Each subclass have a type and value attribute, and each subclass inherits from Ship class:

    - *coordinates* attribute: Stores the coordinates of the ship on the board. The data it's stored as a list of lists.
    - *get_type* method: Gets the type of the ship
    - *get_value* method: Gets the value of the ship

- **Board Class**

    This class stores the following attributes:

    - *name*: Stores the player username
    - *type*: Stores the type of the board(Player or Computer)
    - *size*: Stores the size of the board chosen by the player
    - *board*: Stores a list of list that represents the board
    - *ships*: Stores instances of Ship
    - *misses*: Stores the coordinates of the guesses that missed
    - *sunk*: Stores the coordinates of the ships sunk

    This class also has the following methods:

    - *print*: Prints the board
    - *guess*: Check if there is a ship on the coordinate passed as paramater
    - *add_ship*: Add the ship passed as parameter to the ships attribute
    - *show_ships*: Shows coordinates of the ships on the board attribute.

- ***Game Class**

    This class stores the following attributes:

    - *turns*: Stores the remaining turns of the game
    - *player_name*: Stores the username of the player
    - *player_score*: Stores the player's score
    - *computer_score*: Stores the computer's score
    - *player_board*: Stores an instance of Board for the player
    - *computer_board*: Stores an instance of Board for the computer

    This class also has the following methods:

    - *print_scores*: Prints the current scores
    - *increment_score*: Increments the player or computer score depending on the type parameter.
    - *turns_remaining*: Prints the turns attribute.
